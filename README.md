# Hackathon_2025

Kemppi hackathon repo

## About the Project

This project is built for the Hackathon_2025 event and is split into two main components:

- **Backend:**  
  Implemented in Node.js & Express.js, it handles API calls such as fetching weld data. For example, the [`fetchWelds`](backend/mainService.js) function in [backend/mainService.js](backend/mainService.js) makes requests to the Kemppi welds API.

- **UI:**  
  Developed using Flutter, the user interface is located in [ui/kemppi_ui](ui/kemppi_ui). This front-end component allows users to interact with and visualize data from the backend.
